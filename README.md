## Practical Work of AEDS2 UFMG - Recursive Search

# Description

Practical project of Data Structure and Algorithms 2 (AEDS2) discipline, given by Professor Erickson R. Nascimento.

The objective of this work is to implement a recursive search for a specific value, in this case 0, in digital images in PGM format. This format stores a grayscale image.

A requirement of the work is that a recursive algorithm and a stack must be implemented.
